Our long standing policy towards them up until this point has been to ignore them, letting them naturally leave as time wen on. But as of late the world has seen some drastic changed, and it may be necessary to change course in order to prevent disaster.\n\n If we wish, we could use our cultural ties to the Anabaptists to invite them into court as an independent estate. This could provide great rewards to our nation, but who knows how much we can control them. We could also begin to simply expel them, using as much force as is necessary. This would resolve the situation faster, at a greater risk to stability and prosperity. Or, finally, we could continue the same course."
