 HUD_mission_claims_title:0 "Hudsonian Claims"
 HUD_mission_claims_desc:0 "At it's peak the Kingdom of Hudsonia encompassed even more territory to our south. Though our claim to the old Anabaptist lands is dubious, with some cajoling we should be able to receive right to these ancient claims."
 HUD_mission_cores_title:0 "Recover the Fringes"
 HUD_mission_cores_desc:0 "With the claims of the old Kingdom in hand it is time to march south and take what is ours."
 HUD_mission_deitscherei_title:0 "Push to Deitscherei"
 HUD_mission_deitscherei_desc:0 "The lands of the duchy of Deitscherei were once an Anabaptist kingdom, before being overrun by the Americanists to their east. As the heirs to the Anabaptists kingdom of the north it is only right that we control the Deistch lands aswell."
 HUD_mission_mercs_title:0 "The Orange Army"
 HUD_mission_mercs_desc:0 "The Orange Army of Fordyce Hallenbeck was once able to drive the Redcoats back from Hudsonia, but now their standards lie in dusty corners. It is time we revive this mighty force, as we are once again beset on all sides."
 HUD_mission_fort_newburgh_title:0 "Fortify Newburgh"
 HUD_mission_fort_newburgh_desc:0 "The city of Newburgh sits on our southern border right before Manhattan. If the Gothamites ever decided to join the Redcoats and strike, they would first have to pass through here. IT is therefore crucial the we fortify the city."
 HUD_mission_keystone_title:0 "Capture Keystone"
 HUD_mission_keystone_desc:0 "Keytone is the Americanist term for the lands between Eerie and Manhattan. It is a rich land with many rivers and valleys, all the better to march our armies through. If we are to keep Hudsonia safe we must control it all."
 HUD_mission_manhattan_docks_title:0 "The Manhattan Docks"
 HUD_mission_manhattan_docks_desc:0 "The docks of Manhattan are famously expansive, producing mighty ships since time immemorial. Now that Manhattan is back in our control we should set about restoring these docks so one day Orange ships may sail the waves."

 HUD_mission_germany_desc:0 "The Deitsch have an oral history of an ancient homeland, Deitschland, from which all amerodeitsch hail. We believe that we have found this place across the sea in the Old World. Since we control Deitscherei it is only right that we should control Deitschland too."
 HUD_mission_baltimore_title:0 "The Coastal Cities"
 HUD_mission_baltimore_desc:0 "The coastal cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia are essential trade hubs on the eastern seabord. So long as they remain out of our control much of the trade in the region will manage to slip past our patrols. They must be ours."
 HUD_mission_trade_title:0 "Delaware Trade"
 HUD_mission_trade_desc:0 "With all of the trade hubs of the Delaware under our control, it is high time we invest in them. Merchants have long been complaining of desolate cities, dangerous routes, and inadequate market space. If we are to thrive in Atlantica this must be resolved"
 HUD_mission_greater_germany_title:0 "Greater Deitschland"
 HUD_mission_greater_germany_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely own a part of Deitschland, we must have it all. Wherever there is a field to plow, our flag must fly. Wherever a market place stands, our guards must watch."
 HUD_mission_quebec_title:0 "Court Quebec"
 HUD_mission_quebec_desc:0 "The Province of Quebec played a massive role in putting the Hallenbecks on the throne of Hudsonia, so it is crucial we maintain good relations. If we fail to do so our entire northern border is at risk."

 HUD_mission_vermont_desc:0 "The yankees of Vermont begged for conversion to the Ordinate faith in exchange for protection against the Redcoats.

 HUD_mission_fort_raquette_title:0 "Fortify Raquette"
 HUD_mission_fort_raquette_desc:0 "The province of Raquette lays on the border of Ontario, Quebec, and Vermont. For the moment, none of these nations pose a threat to use, but monarchs do not live forever. To be sure of our safety we must fortify the hills, least we be caught off guard."
 HUD_mission_develop_capital_title:0 "Old and New"
 HUD_mission_develop_capital_desc:0 "The old city of Albany stands dilapidated and rotting from years of neglect. Our newest province of Niagra is still burning from our recent conquest. We should see to restore both of these lands to a working order."
 HUD_mission_develop_countryside_title:0 "Develop the Countryside"
 HUD_mission_develop_countryside_desc:0 "Though covered in farms and barns, the Hudsonia countryside is largely lacking in advanced infrastructure.

 HUD_mission_connecticut_title:0 "Connect Eastward"
 HUD_mission_connecticut_desc:0 "Now that we have sufficiently prepared our infrastructure, it is time to strike the Redcoats where is hurts. The lands of the Connecticut valley are rich, and so long as they remain out of our hands we will remain at risk."

 HUD_mission_merc_army_desc:0 "Because of our decision to work with the Anabaptists, we are missing out on a huge amount of possible recruits. Since we cannot resolve this, we must look to our mercenaries to fill the gap."
 HUD_mission_scavengers_title:0 "The Scavenger Corps"
 HUD_mission_scavengers_desc:0 "In most nations the Scavengers are just members of the public who pick up scavenging. But because of the violent nature of this work, it is unsurprising that Anabaptists have been slow to pick up the profession. It is in our best interest, therefore, to develop a state mercenary band of scavengers, for gold and glory."
 HUD_mission_anabaptist_courts_title:0 "Anabaptist Courts"
 HUD_mission_anabaptist_courts_desc:0 "Being adverse to violence, the Anabaptists have a long history of resolving their disputes through a system of community courts. However, as our nation grows, these courts are no longer sufficient to handle the amount of disputes that arise. We should seek to establish state-sponsored Anabaptist courts across the nation, to guarantee peace at home."
 HUD_mission_first_manufactory_title:0 "The First Factories"
 HUD_mission_first_manufactory_desc:0 "The Anabaptists have always been industrious. But as we continue to improve our technology, they only seem to improve. In order to foster this trait, we should seek to establish a Factory as soon as we can."

 HUD_mission_old_world_anabaptists_desc:0 "The Anabaptists believe that it is not just the Deitsch who came from over the seas. According to their historians the Anabaptist creeds also originate somewhere in the old world. There are many of them who, if we made the proper preparations, would be willing to travel back to settle these ancient lands for us."
 HUD_mission_convert_capital_title:0 "Invite the Ursulines"

 hudsonia_events.1.t:0 "The Right to Preach"
 hudsonia_events.1.d:0 "Ever since the ascension of Fordyce Hallenbeck, relations between Ordinate and Anabaptists in Hudsonia have been fraught. Though the Ordinates protected the Anabaptists from the Redcoats, they also have never given up trying to convert the local population. Their methods have ranged from the polite to the aggressive, annoying and angering various local communities. The Anabaptists, for their part, often refuse taxes for their protection, due to their unwillingness to participate in worldly politics.\n\nBut now, after the Hallenbeck conquest of Niagara, a new problem has arisen. By the law, only the ruling Ordinates can proselytize to the local Rust Cultist population. This has alarmed the Anabaptists, as they fear that through conquest and proselytization they will become a minority in Hudsonia, and will thereby loose their privileges. They have therefore propositioned [Root.Monarch.GetName] for the right to proselytize in our provinces.\n\nSuch a proposition is a risky manuever, as it would likely prevent any formation of independent Clergy, since the Anabaptists are already so large and organized. But it would likely allow for our continued cooperation with our Anabaptist populace, so far as that goes."
