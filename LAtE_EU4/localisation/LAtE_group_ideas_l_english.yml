 feudal_america: "Feudalism"
 feudal_america_desc: "Feudalism, also known as the feudal system, was the combination of the legal, economic, military, and cultural customs that flourished in post-event America between the 26th and 31st centuries. Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships that were derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labor."
 knightly_traditions: "Knightly Traditions"
 knightly_traditions_desc: "A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state or representative for service to the monarch, the church or country, especially in a military capacity. Origins of Knighthood are disputed but it is agreed upon by scholors that they were first popularised in the Holy Columbian Confederacy and later throughout America. Between the 25th and 28th centuries, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the 29th century, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly warrior. Knighthood in post-event America was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 2300s until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the United Kingdoms of Quebec and Ontario in the 3100s. \n\nNew methods of warfare and advancements in military technology (such as muskets, artillery and to a lesser extent, restored pre-event guns) began to render knights in armour obsolete."

A retreat was ordered, and as the army began to leave in shame, the regrouped Americanist army organised an ambush, combined with a sortie by the defenders annihilated the once glorious army.
