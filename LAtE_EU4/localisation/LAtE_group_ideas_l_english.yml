 feudal_america_desc: "Feudalism, also known as the feudal system, was the combination of the legal, economic, military, and cultural customs that flourished in post-event America between the 26th and 31st centuries.

 knightly_traditions: "Knightly Traditions"
 knightly_traditions_desc: "A knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a head of state or representative for service to the monarch, the church or country, especially in a military capacity. Origins of Knighthood are disputed but it is agreed upon by scholors that they were first popularised in the Holy Columbian Confederacy and later throughout America. Between the 25th and 28th centuries, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the 29th century, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly warrior. Knighthood in post-event America was closely linked with horsemanship (and especially the joust) from its origins in the 22nd century until its final flowering as a fashion among the high nobility in the United Kingdoms of Quebec and Ontario during the 31st century. New methods of warfare and advancements in military technology (such as muskets, artillery and to a lesser extent, restored pre-event guns) began to render knights in armour obsolete."
