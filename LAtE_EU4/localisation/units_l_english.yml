 southern_knights:0 "Southern Knights"
 southern_knightsDESCR:0 "The Southern Knight originated in the Holy Columbian territories, where mounted warriors were rewarded with grants of land for their military service. This concept of a powerful warrior elite spread through Eastern America and became an integral part of the feudal system, in which Knights ranked amongst the minor nobility. With the development of the wraparound saddle and stirrups, Knights became more heavily armored and better able to charge down opposing infantry with deadly force. They were also known to fight dismounted using heavy melee weapons when circumstances dictated it."
 minutemen_infantry:0 "Minuteman Infantry"
 minutemen_infantryDESCR:0 "The Minuteman was a professional soldier in Eastern American armies of the late dark ages, named by the Antiquarians for the Ancient American soldier of antiquity. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. During the early Coeval era, Minutemen were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights."
 maritimer_gallowglass_infantry:0 "Maritimer Gallowglass Infantry"
 maritimer_gallowglass_infantryDESCR:0 "The gallowglass were mercenary bands from the Maritimes who, like many Northeastern warriors before them, used the two-handed battle-axe, alongside heavy armor such as chain mail and helmets. They appeared in the Maritimes from the early 23rd century and soon became highly sought-after warriors in the service of the great Mahonic Kings, eventually being raised from their local Yankee subjects. The gallowglass were feared by the Hudsonians as, whilst no match for a heavy medieval army in the open field, they proved a deadly force in small, close confrontations. As a result they were often used by Maritimer and Yankee lords as shock troops in ambush situations. These Northeastern warriors did also find success on the open battlefield, most notably in their debut battle at Washington in 2335."
 contract_infantry:0 "Contract Infantry"
 contract_infantryDESCR:0 "Contract Infantry, being called so by the contract these infantry companies would sign with a lord, were popularized by their employment by several of the presitigious Gothamite houses. The Contractors were not very loyal to their employers often switching sides because of higher pay. When these Contract Soldiers fought each other they also made deals to not harm each other too much and battles between them often became a sort of theater. Contract regiments consisted of armored knights and heavy and light infantry and crossbowmen. They had a monopoly on warfare in much of the Northeast which meant that they still used old weapons and tactics when the other American armies already had switched to infantry consisting of musketeers and pikemen."
 sniper_infantry:0 "Sniper Infantry"
 sniper_infantryDESCR:0 "The longbow was a missile weapon mostly used by Gullah and Gulfard Sniper Infantry from the 26th to the 31st century. The weapon was very accurate and had a long range and was powerful enough to penetrate chain-mail armor. The Gulfards used their snipers to great effect against Holy Columbian excursions for generations, however, with the development of gunpowder, the snipers became obsolete. This was not because it was less powerful than the early muskets but because to become a good longbow-man, you had to train for many years, while training people to use fire-arms was much easier."
 rust_belt_picket_infantry:0 "Rust Belt Picket Infantry"
 rust_belt_picket_infantryDESCR:0 "Pickets were a type of infantry first created in the Rust Belt region of the Great Lakes. They were mostly armed with a long spear or pike. The Landsknechte fought mostly in a square type formation called the Pike Square. When drilled properly and deployed correctly, they presented a unwavering line of pikes that would make any cavalryman shiver at the thought of."
 reformed_gallowglass_infantry:0 "Reformed Gallowglass Infantry"
 reformed_gallowglass_infantryDESCR:0 "As gunpowder weaponry and drill techniques spread through North America the traditional Yankee and Maritimer methods of warfare began to become obsolete, challenging the nearly 1000 year old tradition of the Gallowglass Infantryman. However Yankee and Maritimer mercenaries were still feared as fighters, especially by the encroaching Hudsonian and Canadian armies. Those who adapted to the new techniques were highly valued for their bravery and courage. After the 32nd century many Yankee and Maritimer mercenaries could also be found in armies throughout North America."
 hudsonian_dragoons:0 "Hudsonian Dragoons"
 hudsonian_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Hudsonian Dragoons are cavalrymen who's tradition lies in the dark ages, but as a unit adapting to the gunpowder era by equipping themselves with two pistols and a sword, often wearing a cuirass for protection. Using firearms as their primary weapons they broke with the dark age knight tradition of cavalrymen always being equipped with lances. In battle they would fire their pistols at the enemy line, then attempt a charge and melee combat to rout enemy soldiers."
 interumnelian_housecarl_infantry:0 "Interumnelian Housecarl Infantry"
 interumnelian_housecarl_infantryDESCR:0 "The development of better firearms forced a change in tactics for the Housecarl warriors of the Western Great Lakes. These hardy warriors would now await the first volley from the enemy and then unleash their irresistible charge."
 continental_infantry:0 "Continental Infantry"
 continental_infantryDESCR:0 "The Continental Infantry formation was made up of mixed infantry including pikemen and musketeers. Because of this combined-arms approach, the formation simultaneously enjoyed both the rigidity of its heavy infantry and the long-range firepower of its musketeers, making it an ideal defensive and offensive formation. Continental formations, with their disciplined and spirited professional soldiers, were famed on American battlefields for their nearly invincible manner in combat during the 32nd and 33rd centuries."
 canadian_mounted_men:0 "Canadian Mounted Men"
 canadian_mounted_menDESCR:0 "In the late 32nd and early 33rd century the most common cavalryman for Eastern American cavalry was the Canadian Mounted Man, descending from the Mounted Men of Antiquity, and typically employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged frontally against the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 assault_infantry:0 "Assault Infantry"
 assault_infantryDESCR:0 "The linear descendants of the Maritimer, Northlander, and Yankee mercenaries of early eras. These units placed maximum emphasis on infantry charges to kill and unnerve their enemies. Their charge could be more devastating than the cavalry of the era making them fearsome in attack."
 earlian_infantry:0 "Earlian Infantry"
 earlian_infantryDESCR:0 "In the 32nd century, the musket (a handheld firearm) became commonplace, but they were very slow to reload. Army tacticians typically deployed musket-men in formations to maximize firepower. The muskets would thus be arranged in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. This maximized the firepower of the 32nd century muskets and overcame their disadvantage of slow reloading. It was Earl of Macon who pioneered the use of these musket formations and taught it to Holy Columbian troops in his era."
 grangelander_gallop_cavalry:0 "Grangelander Gallop Cavalry"
 grangelander_gallop_cavalryDESCR:0 "The pistol armed Canadian Mounted Man came to dominate American cavalry tactics in the eastern part of the continent, although the traditional shock action cavalry style of the Tank Cavalry was still in use. Armies trained in Eastern American warfare quite often came out second best in combat against these units. Borne out of the bloodshed of the many plains skirmishes, Grangelander armies developed a different kind of unit, the Grangelander Gallop Cavalry. Although still armed with pistols like the caracole they did not discharge their pistols before the shock action but as a part of the charge itself. The results were typically devastating."
 canadian_highlander_infantry:0 "Canadian Highlander Infantry"
 canadian_highlander_infantryDESCR:0 "The Highland Infantry divisions which made up such a recognizable force in many of Antiquity's Commonwealth armies have their roots in the semi-feudal clan system of north and west Scotland. Scottish Highlanders were lightly armored clansmen, often equipped with the traditional Scottish basket-hilted sword, the claymore, as well as small knives, known as dirks. Later Highland soldiers also carried pistols. They were feared for the ferocity of their attack, particularly the famous Highland Charge, used to smash through enemy lines. The Highland Regiments of Canada effectively returned to this style of fighting in the centuries after The Event, and subsequently became a feared fighting force, noted in particular for bravery and a refusal to surrender."
 harrian_infantry:0 "Harrian Infantry"
 harrian_infantryDESCR:0 "In the early 33rd century the musket had a loading time that was still very slow and musket fire needed to be concentrated in volleys to be destructive, as the weapons were very inaccurate and misfires were common. Such a slow reloading time meant that the unit would be very vulnerable if all the guns were fired simultaneously. Since the days of Earl of Macon this problem was overcome by arranging the unit in lines (twelve, eight or six deep). When the front rank fired, they would move away to the rear to reload, after which the next rank would fire. Harrier Hildebrand, King of Iowa, significantly improved this Earlian infantry tactic. He trained his troops so well that he was able to reduce the number of ranks to only three (one kneeling, the second crouching and, the third standing) and yet still maintain continuous fire."
 reformed_continental_infantry:0 "Reformed Continental Infantry"
 reformed_continental_infantryDESCR:0 "The Continental Infantry was the name assigned to a soldier who fought in mixed formation of pikemen and musketeers developed in the 31st Century. The victories it led the Beltway armies against Holy Columbian incursions would lead to its domination of the American battlefield for 100 years. The early formations contained anywhere from 50-70% pikemen. However, they were still evolving and through experimentation it was found that the number of pikemen required could be reduced. These late formations could have as little as 25% pikemen leading to a massive increase in the formations firepower."
 carolina_infantry:0 "Carolina Infantry"
 carolina_infantryDESCR:0 "The military reforms of the Holy Columbian princes of the Carolinas created a new force of infantry, specializing in the attack. Devastating volleys of musket rounds would be the prelude to a mass charge."
 frontiersmen_infantry:0 "Frontiersmen Infantry"
 frontiersmen_infantryDESCR:0 "In the mid 34th century the border marches of the Holy Columbian Confederacy found themselves in need of a soldier to defend their loosely settled frontiers, and thus the Frontiersmen Infantry were born. The men were recruited from the local population and were given land in return for their military service. Frontiersmen regiments were considered light infantry. They mostly fought in a skirmishing role but could also function as infantry of the line."
 line_infantry:0 "Line Infantry"
 line_infantryDESCR:0 "Line infantry tactics tried to find a balance between attack and defense and did not specialize in either. However, these infantry were stronger in fire and shock. Their aim would be to use the musket volleys to disorganize the enemy before they could charge, in particular if they were primarily a shock action force."
 assault_cavalry:0 "Assault Cavalry"
 assault_cavalryDESCR:0 "While the Tank Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock, and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, the Assault Cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."

 reformed_hudsonian_dragoonsDESCR:0 "In the 33rd century, the Dragoons of Hudsonia came into their own, adopting a form of combat more traditionally associated with the name. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations, mostly because they were cheaper than normal cavalry."
 reformed_posse_cavalry:0 "Reformed Posse Cavalry"
 reformed_posse_cavalryDESCR:0 "The first Posse Cavalry were used in the late dark ages as light cavalry skirmishers and raiders, however the need for a similar unit was found in the 34th century, and thus the Posses would ride again. The new Posse Cavalry were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more the Heavily Armored Cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on in the 34th Century they became an essential part of the military's structure due to their light armor making them fast and agile on the battlefield and for their high shock value against their enemies, which in some cases turned the tide in Battles. The New Posses were a good alternative to large Infantry Armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller Nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 maple_coat_infantry:0 "Maple Coat Infantry"
 maple_coat_infantryDESCR:0 "The Maple Coat has its origins in the Canadian army, where the sparse population of the territory meant it was important to husband your resources. Trained and drilled to withstand fire attacks, these troops relied on sheer staying power to keep them in the fight."

 enforcer_infantryDESCR:0 "In order to help turn the tide of many battles, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed Canadian armies. The use of loose order infantry was revolutionary on the American battlefield. The most extreme solution was the impulse warfare unit. These units put forward a cloud of skirmishers whose constant sniping would disorder and demoralize the enemy before the mass charge of columned infantry would deliver the coup de grace."

 eastern_square_infantryDESCR:0 "In order to help turn the tide of many battles, irregular units from the military frontier were brought up to the main battlefields to help the hard pressed imperial armies. The loose order of infantry was revolutionary on the European battlefield, however there were those that totally rejected the skirmisher concept and went for rigid linear tactics. Christened Square Infantry due to the formation they assumed when defending against cavalry. These were tightly disciplined units trained to fire their muskets at a high rate and fire by platoon which meant that rather than use the single volley and reload style during combat, these units would always have a platoon discharging their muskets. The deadly ripple fire could break any assault. However, rigid linear tactics made these units less mobile and more defensive."

His body was protected with a breastplate, the Cuirass from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords.

 plinker_infantryDESCR:0 "In Dixieland in the 34th century a new type of light infantry came into being, called Plinkers. Plinkers were used for reconnaissance and skirmishing. At first they were recruited from huntsmen, gamekeepers and foresters. Most of them were excellent riflemen and were therefore often used as snipers, who could inflict great losses amongst enemy officers. Later Plinker became a generic name for all kinds of light infantry. Plinker troops were often hired as cheap mercenaries by other nations."

However in the Great Plains Opponents who came from a steppe tradition had lighter armed cavalry which was more suitable for skirmishing. These units showed their worth at the several times over in the field. To counter this many armies had a number of units termed 'Tanks', after the armored breakthrough cavalry of antediluvian times, which were lighter cavalry more suited to fighting their plains based opponents."

 plains_outlawsDESCR:0 "While they would make an early entry firearms where slow to make a big difference on the plains due to the mobile nature of warfare. Cavalry would continue to be the dominant arm for the plains armies throughout the early modern era before firearms would be made lighter and more accurate.

 plains_tribesmen:0 "Plains Tribesmen"
 plains_tribesmenDESCR:0 "The mobile nature of plains warfare always meant that infantry would be at a disadvantage to cavalry in terms of mobility and in the great open landscapes this meant that many sedentary infantry tactics would be far less viable in the plains. In order to counter this plains infantry would frequently form wagon forts in battle, which allowed them a protected mobility on the battlefield. Protected by the wagon forts infantry could make use of fire arms and bows while still remaining safe from cavalry attacks."
