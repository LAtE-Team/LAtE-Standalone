 cetic_events.1.t:0 "Harmonization of Pagan Faiths"
 cetic_events.1.d:0 "Our efforts to integrate our [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] subjects have now finally started to pay off. Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of Ceticism and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider Cetic corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards. Even among prominent officials in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a small altar can sometimes be found to a [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] pantheon.\nPaganism has become one of the many religions of our Cetic [Root.GovernmentName]."

 cetic_events.2.t:0 "Harmonization of Christianity"
 cetic_events.2.d:0 "Over time our Christian subjects have grown accustomed to our ways and taken to our rites and our superior administrative ideals. Where there was once distrust in the classics and our system for education and governance there is now widespread understanding. In turn our Christian subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the best educated Cetic scholars can be seen partaking in Christian customs and visiting Christian churches."

 cetic_events.3.t:0 "Harmonization of Islam"
 cetic_events.3.d:1 "Islam has been a minority religion in our lands for centuries. Over time, however, it has grown into a more and more integrated part of our society. Muslim ideals have been integrated and harmonized with our traditions, rites and methods and we have taken the best of what the religion has had to offer to mold to our own uses. Islamic scholars, doctors, merchants, farmers and peasants can be found even in the districts around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]. As long as they bend the knee to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] the followers of Allah are an integral part of our society."

 cetic_events.4.t:0 "Harmonization of the Dharmic Religions"
 cetic_events.4.d:0 "The faith of the Dharmic peoples has been intertwined with our own for millennia yet our beliefs have diverged for almost as long. For a long time it was believed that where we lauded reason and classical learning they strived for diversity and an ancient spiritual power. Over the last years, however, we have strived to integrate the Dharmic society with ours and make their beliefs fit in with our equally strong traditions of philosophy and learning. As we look ahead a common future beckons where the diversity of the Dharmic pantheon can be cherished together with the Cetic classics. Together we have created a new stronger set of rites and traditions for a stronger and more durable state."

 cetic_events.5.t:0 "Harmonization of Judaism"
 cetic_events.5.d:0 "It has been centuries since the first Jews arrived in our country but it is not until recently that we have had this great numbers of them in our society. In a newfound fascination for their ancient Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education. As we have strived to harmonize the Cetic classics with the teachings of the Torah Jewish philosophers, traders, soldiers and artisans have become evermore present parts of our society. Eventually as traditions fuse these people have become a cornerstone of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 cetic_events.5.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.6.t:0 "Harmonization of Zoroastrianism"
 cetic_events.6.d:0 "The bearers of a tradition that is said to be even older than our own the Zoroastrians are a people that have seen their political influence come and then fade. It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization, fusing the ancient teachings of Zoroaster with those of Confucius. We are still a country where the classics are learned and lived by but Zoroastrians are now an integral part of our society and to some extent their wisdom has become ours."
 cetic_events.6.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.7.t:0 "Harmonization of the Shinto Faith"
 cetic_events.7.d:0 "The Japanese have over time come to incorporate both the traditions of Confucius and Buddha into their own old Shinto faith, taking what they feel was the truest and best serving parts of the foreign teachings and making it their own. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Shinto identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinto followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 cetic_events.7.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.8.t:0 "Harmonization of the Theravada Faith"
 cetic_events.8.d:0 "The Pali Cannons of Theravada Buddhism are in many ways a familiar way to organize tradition and learning to our Cetic elites. Over time these collections of laws and rites have come to be studied and made part of the corpus that every educated and influential member of our society must study and adhere to. The traditions have been harmonized and the wider Theravada Buddhist community consider us their equal just as we consider the Theravada Buddhists within our borders as an integral part of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 cetic_events.8.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.9.t:0 "Harmonization of the Mahayana Faith"
 cetic_events.9.d:0 "Centuries ago the teachings of Buddha started to penetrate our lands and by now it is one of the most widespread religions in [Root.GetName]. While we hold the classics of Cetic learning to be the guiding principle of our [Root.GovernmentName] we also honor the traditions of Buddha and the yearning for an end to the eternal cycle that many of our subjects feel.\nTruly we are a Cetic country ruled by a people of Mahayana Buddhists."
 cetic_events.9.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.10.t:0 "Harmonization of Vajrayana Buddhism"
 cetic_events.10.d:0 "Those of our subjects that are ardent followers of the great and mysterious Lamas have increasingly come to realize how useful an ideology the teachings of Confucius are. Where they once used the traditions of the Vajrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have. Vajrayana monks and nobles are now part of our government both at the very top and at the very bottom and their somewhat wild and Tantric traditions appears to have been tamed by our reason and learning."
 cetic_events.10.a:0 "'Submit the people of virtue, assimilate the people with enlightenment.'"
 cetic_events.11.t:0 "Concept of Shangdi"
 cetic_events.11.d:0 "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Cetic concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shangdi with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of Cetic concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to Californians."
 cetic_events.11.a:0 "We must teach them the proper ways!"
 cetic_events.11.b:0 "Let us accommodate this abstraction."
 cetic_events.12.t:0 "Translations of the Classics"
 cetic_events.12.d:0 "The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of Confucius?"
 cetic_events.12.a:0 "Let them create their own version of proper form."
 cetic_events.12.b:0 "This would be a travesty on our ideology!"
 cetic_events.13.t:0 "Faith of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]"
 cetic_events.13.d:0 "Our trusted minister and confidant, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has worked closely with our [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] community in order to help them elevate their barbarian culture. Surprised at [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] findings, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has started to adopt many [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] concepts after studying their science and literature intensely. Many worry that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] has gotten too taken in by [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ways. Some even claim that our [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] has secretly converted, shaming [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] ancestors and the [Root.GovernmentName] alike."
 cetic_events.13.a:0 "Depose this [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetWomanMan]!"
 cetic_events.13.b:0 "We have much to learn from the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people."
 cetic_events.14.t:0 "Rights and Rite"
 cetic_events.14.d:1 "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the Cetic teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 cetic_events.14.a:0 "Barbarians!"
 cetic_events.14.b:0 "Such minor things do not concern us."
 cetic_events.15.t:0 "Empowering the Office of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 cetic_events.15.d:0 "While the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] are barbarians, they have some customs and rites that we might make use of. As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels. Others argue that we would be shaming our ancestors and turning our back on what is proper if we allowed these traditions to contaminate ours."
 cetic_events.15.a:0 "I like the sound of this..."
 cetic_events.15.b:0 "It is the shameful officials we need to deal with!"
 cetic_events.16.t:0 "Bringing Civilization to the Barbarians"
 cetic_events.16.d:2 "Over time the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people have come to take to many of our customs. When our [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetTitle] [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] visited the area of [harmonization_province.GetName], [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] found that they are still far from civilized, however. When a local influential landholder, Lord [Root.local_influential_person.GetName], invited [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim] to participate in a naming ceremony for his son in which he named the boy after himself, that was the final straw.\n\n[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] returned from the area with a very low opinion of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people and of their prospects to ever count themselves among the civilized people of the world."
 cetic_events.16.a:0 "We will leave them to their own devices then."
 cetic_events.16.b:0 "Let us send our best and brightest to civilize them."
 cetic_events.17.t:0 "[harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] Civilization"
 cetic_events.17.d:2 "Some barbarians are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] people of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor eccentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 cetic_events.17.a:0 "Progress!"
 cetic_events.17.b:0 "We must use this opportunity regionally!"
 cetic_events.18.t:0 "Xiaoren?"
 cetic_events.18.d:0 "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our imperial heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are, however, factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."
 cetic_events.18.a:0 "Such a [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] is not fit for the Palace of the East."
 cetic_events.18.b:0 "We need the support of the factions behind the [Root.Heir.GetTitle]."
 cetic_events.19.t:1 "Popular Novel"
 cetic_events.19.d:1 "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Cetic ideology as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 cetic_events.19.a:1 "It must be banned immediately."
 cetic_events.19.b:1 "We lead by example not decree. Let it be."
 cetic_events.20.t:1 "Civil Service"
 cetic_events.20.d:1 "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the classics are the backbone of Cetic government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."
 cetic_events.20.a:1 "We must expand the bureaucracy!"
 cetic_events.20.b:0 "There is no need to reinforce the cadres just yet."
