 renaissance:1 "Iterumnalia"
 desc_renaissance:1 "Since the 30th century the wealthy and powerful in Laurentia have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the Old World societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Iterumnalia already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Old World philosophers. Iterumnalia Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Iterumnalia Humanist is an expert on everything from Politics and Philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Iterumnalia is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_feudalism:1 "Over the course of human history, most societies developed a need for a common structure with stronger and more permanent institutions of government. After the event this need came to be filled by a number of institutions and customs that taken together are often considered to be part of the American Feudal system. For similar reasons, permanent government and societal systems have formed all over the world, some of which have roots that go far further back than Feudalism itself.\n \nUnlike the other Institutions, 'Feudalism' covers a wide range of different systems and exists from the start in all parts of the world where a strong tradition of Urbanism, Institutionalized Government and Social Stratification has reached a critical point. The institution can spread from contact with any of these cultures, or in some cases begin to grow on its own in a society that fulfills certain criteria."
