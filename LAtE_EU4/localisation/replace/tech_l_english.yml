 renaissance:1 "Iterumnalia"
 desc_renaissance:1 "Since the 30th century the wealthy and powerful in the city states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the Old World societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Iterumnalia already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Old World philosophers. Iterumnalia Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Iterumnalia Humanist is an expert on everything from Politics and Philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Iterumnalia is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
