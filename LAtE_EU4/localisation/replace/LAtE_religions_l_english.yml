Each Loa is responsible for a different aspect of life, and vodouists develop a personal relationship with them through elaborate ceremonies that can include ritual offerings, song, dance, and allowing themselves to be possessed by the spirits so that Loa and vodouist may communicate."

After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from their number. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Catholic Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope."

Sedevacantists reject the authority of the Pope of New Rome, denying his right to call himself successor of the Pope of Old Rome because it cannot be established if the Papacy of the Old World still exists. Even if it has ceased to exist, they reject the notion that the Bishop of New Rome (St. Louis) could or should have the same authority as the original Pope. They argue that the Primacy of Rome cannot be duplicated merely out of convenience, feel the Bishop of New Rome has no more right to be head of their faith than any other bishop in the land, and call his College of Cardinals a sham and cabal of co-conspirators. Instead, Sedevancantists believe the office of Pope should be considered 'vacant' until a true Pope returns, unless it can be confirmed the original Papacy is no more."

 brethren: "Brethren"
 brethren_religion_desc: "With a strong tradition of seafaring and a reputation for robbery and murder, most call the Brethren pirates. This assessment is not far from the truth. Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth."

 pelagic: "Pelagic"
 pelagic_religion_desc: "Followers of the Pelagic faith roam the seven seas, much like their Brethren cousins. However, that is where their similarities end. Rather than live through piracy and murder, Pelagics instead draw on the natural gifts of the sea. In particular, Pelagics regard whales as the most powerful of all seaborne beings, capable of both giving and taking life at a moment's notice. Pelagics work to gain the favor of the sea goddess, Sedna, creator of the sea and mother of all its creatures, so that she may give them her gifts via her first and greatest child - the whale."

 jewish_religion_desc: "Judaism is one of the oldest religions on the planet, and it survived the Event like it did so many other catastrophes. Although Judaism itself has changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event America now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since they left the Old Country. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Haredim still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, in due time, gather the Jews living in exile and return them to the land promised to their forefathers."

 reform_faith_religion_desc: "Reform Judaism first split from Orthodox Judaism in the 19th century, under the belief that in order for Judaism to survive in the modern age, it should reform to be more compatible with a modern, secular lifestyle. Reform Judaism regards Halacha (Jewish religious law) as non-binding, permits women to be ordained as rabbis, and is overall more open to external influences than Orthodx Judaism."

 meshichist: "Meshichist"
 meshichist_religion_desc: "Meshichists believe that a legendary pre-Event rabbi, known to them as simply "the Rebbe", was the Moshiach - the Jewish Messiah. Mainstream Jews reject this view, pointing out that the Rebbe has been dead for centuries, which would normally disqualify him from being the Moshiach. Nevertheless, Meshichists remain steadfast in their belief that the Rebbe was - and is - the Moshiach, believing that he is still alive in a metaphorical sense. Meshichists frequently recite the Yechi, an affirmation of their belief in a living "King Messiah", at prayer services and during holidays."

Post-Event Hinduism differs radically from pre-Event Hinduism in several key ways. For example, the vast majority of Hindus now reject the caste system, believing instead that all humans are spiritually equal. Proselytization towards non-Hindus has also become more common."
