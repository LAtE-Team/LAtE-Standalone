Each Loa is responsible for a different aspect of life, and vodouists develop a personal relationship with them through elaborate ceremonies that can include ritual offerings, song, dance, and allowing themselves to be possessed by the spirits so that Loa and vodouist may communicate."

After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from their number. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Catholic Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope."

Sedevacantists reject the authority of the Pope of New Rome, denying his right to call himself successor of the Pope of Old Rome because it cannot be established if the Papacy of the Old World still exists. Even if it has ceased to exist, they reject the notion that the Bishop of New Rome (St. Louis) could or should have the same authority as the original Pope. They argue that the Primacy of Rome cannot be duplicated merely out of convenience, feel the Bishop of New Rome has no more right to be head of their faith than any other bishop in the land, and call his College of Cardinals a sham and cabal of co-conspirators. Instead, Sedevancantists believe the office of Pope should be considered 'vacant' until a true Pope returns, unless it can be confirmed the original Papacy is no more."

Some of these offshoots relocated to the United States during the 20th century, and fell out of communion with the St. Louis Papacy after the Event, instead turning to the Legal of the East to lead their faith. Because of this, Nestorians are now considered by most to be a Catholic heresy."

 trailwalker: "Trailwalker"
 trailwalker_religion_desc: "Trailwalker is a religion invested in the borderland, the crossings between flesh, soul, and dream. Trailwalkers believe in an omnipresent spiritual plane called the Frontier, ruled by a pantheon headed by the Almighty Spirit of the West. In the beginning, there was only the Frontier, and men lived short and harsh lives. However, the Almighty Spirit took pity on humanity and, with the help of his otherworldly servants, cleaved the Range from the Frontier. The Range was the new home of humanity, where men could live free lives. However, in exchange for this gift, the Almighty Spirit asked humanity to follow the Trails, the righteous paths through life. Mankind at first heeded his words, but eventually turned away from the Trails and took the Range for granted. In anger, the Almighty Spirit briefly reunited the Frontier and the Range, destroying mankind's works. Mankind should never again stray from the Trails..."

Most of humanity perished in the darkness of Ragnarok, along with the false gods of ancient America and many of the Aesir, including Odin and Thor. Thor sacrificed himself to protect the last of humanity, but in a miracle of miracles he rose from the dead, ending Ragnarok. Thor now leads the surviving gods in the post-Ragnarok age. However, the dead gods are not truly gone - their restless spirits sometimes return to roam the earth alongside man. The followers of the Thunderer will be protected from the dead gods, just as they were protected during Ragnarok..."

The core tenet of Druidism is animism - the belief that all of nature is inhabited by divine spirits. Although Druidism was once commonly practiced throughout the North Atlantic, it has been mostly supplanted by other religions and is today only practiced on the fringes of its old territory."

Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth."

Rather than live through piracy and murder, Pelagics instead draw on the natural gifts of the sea. In particular, Pelagics regard whales as the most powerful of all seaborne beings, capable of both giving and taking life at a moment's notice. Pelagics work to gain the favor of the sea goddess, Sedna, creator of the sea and mother of all its creatures, so that she may give them her gifts via her first and greatest child - the whale."

Although Judaism itself has changed relatively little over the last few centuries, the Jews of post-Event America now face discrimination and persecution on a scale unheard of since they left the Old Country. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, Haredim still patiently await the arrival of the Moshiach, who will, in due time, gather the Jews living in exile and return them to the land promised to their forefathers."

Reform Judaism regards Halacha (Jewish religious law) as non-binding, permits women to be ordained as rabbis, and is overall more open to external influences than Orthodx Judaism."

Mainstream Jews reject this view, pointing out that the Rebbe has been dead for centuries, which would normally disqualify him from being the Moshiach. Nevertheless, Meshichists remain steadfast in their belief that the Rebbe was - and is - the Moshiach, believing that he is still alive in a metaphorical sense. Meshichists frequently recite the Yechi, an affirmation of their belief in a living "King Messiah", at prayer services and during holidays."

Post-Event Hinduism differs radically from pre-Event Hinduism in several key ways. For example, the vast majority of Hindus now reject the caste system, believing instead that all humans are spiritually equal. Proselytization towards non-Hindus has also become more common."
