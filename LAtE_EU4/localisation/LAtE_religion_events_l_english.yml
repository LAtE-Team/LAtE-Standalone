 legal_flavor.1.t: "The Non-Possessor Movement"
 legal_flavor.1.d: "The Judiciary is a large landowner and this has brought a great deal of wealth to the Judiciary. The non-possessors claim that the Judiciary is being corrupted by this great wealth. Their opponents argue that the Judiciary needs this wealth to maintain law and order. The key thing is the Judiciary isn't really a big taxpayer, if it was forced to give its land away it would move it into the hands of people we can tax. The downside would be the Judiciary would have less wealth to perform its mission."
 legal_flavor.1.a: "Support the Judiciary Authorities"
 legal_flavor.1.b: "Support the Movement"
 legal_flavor.2.t: "A Great Constitutional Convention"
 legal_flavor.2.d: "The Judiciary has gathered in a great Constitutional Convention, they are asking for your support and certain privileges in return for helping fight anti-feudal heresies that are stalking our land. Do we help the Judiciary keep the people in their place or do we support these movements to break up the old Feudal order."
 legal_flavor.2.a: "Grant the Privileges"
 legal_flavor.2.b: "They are on their Own"
 legal_flavor.3.t: "Liturgical Reform"
 legal_flavor.3.d: "The Judiciary is the highest order in the land. However, our realm is large and diverse. Our high judge is proposing some reforms to our liturgy that will bring our laws closer to the other realms. The idea is bold and will strengthen the Judiciary but we know that the superstitious and backward will reject this change."
 legal_flavor.3.a: "Support the Reform"
 legal_flavor.3.b: "Hold true to the old ways"
 legal_flavor.4.t: "Reduce the Independence of the Judiciary"
 legal_flavor.4.d: "The Judiciary is a powerful institution, but more important a wealthy one. If we were to rein in the Judiciary and make more a part of the state we would also bring in more income for taxation. On the other hand we would also sap its authority in the eyes of the masses."
 legal_flavor.4.a: "Reign them in"
 legal_flavor.4.b: "Protect their Independence"
 legal_flavor.5.t: "State appointed Lay Members?"
 legal_flavor.5.d: "If we were to promote and strengthen the powers of lay members of the Judiciary administration and bring in more state appointments, we would bring the Judiciary under central control. The other side of the coin is that we will damage the Judiciary's moral standing with the people."
 legal_flavor.5.a: "Appoint them"
 legal_flavor.5.b: "Let the Holy Judiciary be"

As the city itself was under occupation his sorrow was shared by many of his [Root.GetAdjective] brethren. The very next day it was as if the icon had heard his prayers. The loyal people of [eleusa_church_province.GetName] rose as one and evicted the remaining enemy forces.\nThe continued fortunes of the province seem unclear but as war and devastation haunt the [Root.GetAdjective] countryside many of our citizens are turning to the church for consolation and moral support."

 orthodox_icon_events.3.d: "A recent recruitment campaign in [michael_icon_church_province.GetName] has given rise to an unprecedented number of new recruits enlisting. The local clergy is convinced that this was the result of the widespread religious fervor that our icon of Lincoln has inspired. They report that young men have been coming from all parts of the area to see the icon of the Liberator and that they leave with a strong will to go to war in the name of their faith."

 orthodox_icon_events.4.t: "The Preserver"
 orthodox_icon_events.4.d: "As the preserver, Roosevelt watches from above, in many of the church-domes around the country. Our veneration and extensive attention to this most central icon in any iconostasis also seem to have been the source of contemplation for many. Reminded of their own role in creation and of the rightful place of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] many are more content with both their own lives and with the government that rules them."

One gift will go to the cathedral where he saw the icon, one to the artist who created it and one to the benefactor who paid for it."
