 monetarism.3.d:0 "The gospel of wealth has spread across the world like wildfire, with kingdom after kingdom converting to Consumerism. However, schisms have began to develop within the National Mall. The prevailing interpretation of the Prophet's Catalog is that followers should strive to amass wealth so that they can buy more goods and placate the Invisible Hand, but a new sect called the Monetarists has emerged which challenges this. They argue that the accumulation of wealth is an end in itself, and that spending it profanes the Almighty Dollar. Though mainstream Consumerists have rejected this doctrine as heresy, many rulers and priests have professed their allegiance to the Monetarist doctrine, and the schism threatens to divide the whole Consumerist world."

 canada.EVTNAME1: "The Canadian Wedding"
 canada.EVTDESC1: "[root.getname], King of Québéc, was married to Princess [root.getname] of Ontario in [GetYear]. The princess and heir to Ontario was in a precarious position, and needed outside help to deal with rebellious vassals. The court of Québéc saw an opportunity for expansion, and a way to end the constant skirmishes with one of their neighbours. King [root.getname] would proceed to spend much of his reign putting down rebellions in Ontario, both from Ontarian nobles attempting to press their claims to the throne and from peasant unrest instigated by the religious authorities of the kingdom. Rumours of all kind spread like wildfire, including assertions that the King and Queen hated each other, claims that Queen [root.getname] took other women to bed when King [root.getname] was away, and other, altogether darker rumours. Many hold King [root.getname] in high regard for bringing unity to the long separate realms. Others see his name as a curse, considering him nothing more than a foreign conqueror with queer customs and a strange religion."

 nys_idea_4:0 "Vigilantes"
 nys_idea_4_desc:0 "Perhaps it is a consequence of the city’s libertarian origins, or maybe it has to do with how easy it is to hide away amongst the ruins. For whatever reason, for as long as anyone can remember New York has seen strange fools take the law into their own hands.

But in the patrician culture of Colima, where rivalries between great houses fuel blood feuds that last generations, these duels take on extra significance. The fortunes of many great families have been decided by victory or defeat in these duels. To wear the mask of the Luchador is to commit one’s honor and the honor of all their ancestors to victory in combat."

 flavor_NYS.1.TITLE: "A Christian Republic"
 flavor_NYS.1.DESC: "Following the Holy Columbian conquest of Gotham in 2996, the city of Manhattan and its surrounding areas were placed under the direct control of the Emperor, with the other areas of Gotham being parceled out to other Southern houses. This new state of affairs greatly disrupted the business of the patrician houses of the City, who were robbed of the commercial privileges they had granted themselves under the Republic of New York. Even worse, Confederate laws for conquered territory restricted property-ownership rights to Christians, leaving the Americanist great families of Manhattan liable to have their wealth confiscated. The patricians of New York quickly chose gold over Gods, converting to Christianity, spending lavishly on gaudy new Cathedrals and competing with one another to see who could proclaim their love of God and His gospel the loudest. The point of these displays was not to gain the love of God, but rather the love of the Emperor. And at last in 3001, after receiving countless petitions, gifts, and proclamation of loyalty, the Emperor relented and gave the city extensive privileges and liberties, proclaiming the Confederate Christian Republic of New York. The republic swiftly returned to its former glory, reclaiming much of its original possessions through guile, bribery, and the occasional open war. Now the preeminent commercial center on the Eastern Seaboard, it is tradition for newly elected Consuls of New York to re-pledge their allegiance to Christ and the Confederacy before entering office, as a reminder of the deal that bought them their freedom."

Shortly afterwards, they brought into custody a young man found in a nearby alley struggling to get out of a tight-fitting red mummer’s costume, with a coil of rope in his possession. Our officers have identified him as one Peter Parquagh, though he insists on calling himself “The Gentile Neighborhood Spider-man”. While he is clearly unsound of mind, there can be no doubting his effectiveness – upon further investigation, we have found many credible reports of a red-masked man foiling would-be vagabonds.

Despite the best efforts of the §YAlleghenians§!, their kingdom has become nearly landlocked as §YHudsonia§! demanded their lakeside territory of §YNiagara§!, cutting them off from their previous stranglehold over the bountiful trade flowing between §YLake Ontario§! and the rest of the §YGreat Lakes§!, for now.\n \nEven in the post-apocalyptic Americas, §YAtlantica§! is in many ways the economic heartland of the §YEastern Seaboard§!, home to countless guilds and artisans, and commanding trade in the whole region. Any nation that can assert control over the many small counts, dukes, and republics that call this region home will grow very powerful indeed."
 string_start_HCC:0 "§YThe Holy Columbian Confederacy§! is no state, but rather a loose confederation of small dukedoms, city-states, and republics, with the elected §YEmperor§! wielding only nominal authority. In 3053, that title is held by the §YWaltneys§! of §YFlorida§!, a proud house who trace their ancestry back to the ancient §YHouse of Mouse§!. The §YWaltneys§! control most of the §YFloridian peninsula§!, as well the banks of the §YSavannah River§!, thanks to an opportune political marriage. Such political marriages were common throughout the §YConfederacy’s§! history, and in 3053 many of its princes claim control of lands far separated from their seats of power. As modern statecraft advances and rulers consolidate their power, these princes’ efforts to exert their influence across their disparate realms will shape the history of the §YConfederacy§! for centuries to come. \n \nIn 3053, the §YConfederacy§! encompasses much of §YSoutheastern North America§!. In the West, the §YGumps§! of §YMagnolia§! guard the eastern bank of the §YMississippi River§!. Long the border march of the §YConfederacy§!, the house of §YGump§! now looks to expand their dominion over the river lands. To their south sits the burgeoning §YCreole§! republic of §YOrleans§!, the foremost merchant city of the §YGulf of Mexico§!. To their east lie their naval rivals, the dukes of §YMuskogee§!. \n \nThe fertile heartland of the §YConfederacy§! is a patchwork of small dukedoms vying for power and influence. Among these, rising powers include the §Yelectors§! of §YPeachtree§!, the §YTuskeegan§! duke of §YSantee§!, and the duke of The §YSandhills§!."
string_start_great_lakes:0 “The §YOrdinate§! victory in their §YCrusade§! against the §YRust Cultists§! of §YMichigan§! in 3048 marks a fundamental divergence from the established trends and cycles of the previous centuries in the §YGreat Lakes§!. §YDetroit§!, previously a diverse hub of trade, commerce, culture, and wealth, the metaphorical ‘City of the World's Desire’ of post-event America is under a new ruling class. §YDetroit§! finds itself out of the hands of the §YRust Cultist Merchants§!, as its commoners now awake to find §YOrdinate§! Lords, Nobles, and Knights commuting through their streets and browsing their markets as the city serves as the §YOrdinate§! Capital of their Kingdom of §YMichigan§!. This new Kingdom is not without struggles however. The §YAnglicans§! of §YOntario§! are not pleased to find themselves utterly surrounded by §YOrdinate§! realms, leading to the Kings of §YOntario§! to constantly prepare their Kingdom for conflict with the fledgling §YMichigan§!. The unruly §YNorse§! of the §YUpnorth§! always need an eye kept on them, especially if the §YNorse§! of the §YUpper Peninsula§!, §YMinnesota§!, and §YWisconsin§! manage to cast off the death throes of stagnation and unite into a §YViking§! state not seen since the Soadys of the dark ages. The §YRust Cultist§! Picketer’s pikes point directly at §YDetroit§!, the §YRust Cultist§! Faithful united in an alliance clad in steel against the §YOrdinate§! foothold in the §YGreat Lakes§!. Even brothers in faith, the §YKings§! of §YQuebec§! find themselves in a disapproval of the new §YMichigan§!, their ears filled with sour words from their §YUrsuline§! advisors and ministers, bitter and angered at their empowerment of their rivaling §YAngeline Order§!. The world is a dangerous place for the emerging §YMichigan§!, however, if it overcomes these challenges it may find itself as the de facto §YLord of All Lakes§!, the very beating heart of unfathomable commerce and wealth, a superpower with the prestige to perhaps rival even the golden days of §YOld America§!./n /nThis is not to say that §YMichigan§! is the only candidate for such an empire, despite the major blow in their loss of §YMichigan§!, the §YRust Cultists§! are still capable of ascension to greatness. With their alliance against the §YOrdinates§! and by de facto the same §YCatholics§! that had been encroaching on their rust belt heartland for centuries, there is security, for now. Even with this alliance these §YRust Cultists§! are not impervious, as they are still locked between the §YOrdinates§!, §YCatholics§!, and §YAmericanists§!. The §YCatholics§! of §YChicagoland§!, §YKentuckiania§!, and §YPennyrile§! threaten to split their world in two, if they continue their eastward march up the §YOhio River§!. And while the §YViking§! raids of previous ages are no longer a concern, the §YRust Cultists§! find themselves in battle with a new enemy from the lakes, in that very same emerging §YOrdinate§! Crusader Kingdom of §YMichigan§! whose formation forced them into this defensive crouch. While the future looks bleak, if these sour prospects are overcome, one might find oneself as the Emperor of the mythical §YAutoman Empire§!, a hypothetical state spoken of for centuries as if it were a dream, but it is not impossible for this dream to be made manifest./n /nThe §YNorse Vikings§! themselves are no longer feared as they were in the dark ages as the reavers of the §YGreat Lakes§!, as their golden age of raiding comes to a close as the world moves on, they and their old §YRust Cultist§! enemies both surrounded on all sides by §YCatholics§!, §YAnglicans§!, and §YOrdinates§!. Stagnation encircles their states, their tribes, their lodges, and their shrines like a strangling serpent, choking the very life out of them. Fortunately for those §YNorse§! faithful, there is still time. Perhaps it is not yet time for their §YVikings§! and their longships and gods and sagas and all that makes them §YNorse§! to enter mere cultural memory and eventually nothing more than dusty tomes as has happened to the practices and traditions of many other dark age paganisms. Perhaps, if the stars align, and the gods are happy, one will come along to unite the §YNorse§! of the §YGreat Lakes§! into one army and commence raids of a scale not seen since the Soady Kings of §YSuperior§! half a millennium prior."
