 neognostic: "Neo-Gnostic"
 neognostic_religion_desc: "Neo-Gnostism (re)emerged in Colorado as a syncretic faith combining teachings coming from the the Cetic west and the Catholic east. Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God with the rejection of the material world often found in Cetic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightment through his teachings. Gnostics see material processions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world (matter, flesh) as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis' of God (knowledge, enlightenment, salvation)."
 neoroman: "Sedevacantist"
 neoroman_religion_desc: "The name Sedevancantists comes from the Latin term 'Sede Vacante', meaning 'the seat is vacant'. Sedevacantists reject the authority of the Pope of New Rome, denying his right to call himself successor of the Pope of Old Rome because it cannot be established if the Papacy of the Old World still exists. Even if it has ceased to exist, they reject the notion that the Bishop of New Rome (St. Louis) could or should have the same authority as the original Pope. They argue that the Primacy of Rome cannot be duplicated merely out of convenience, feel the Bishop of New Rome has no more right to be head of their faith than any other bishop in the land, and call his College of Cardinals a sham and cabal of co-conspirators. Instead, Sedevancantists believe the office of Pope should be considered 'vacant' until a true Pope returns, unless it can be confirmed the original Papacy is no more."
 ursuline: "Ursuline"
 ursuline_religion_desc: "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. Introduced to the Americas during the colonial era, their presence could be found wherever the French colonized. During and shortly after the great cataclysm, Quebecois Roman Catholics, unable to contact old Rome, turned to the Ursuline order for leadership. Since then the Ursulines have served as Quebec's continuation of antediluvian Catholicism, and their followers have steadfastly refused to recognize the American Pope in New Rome."
 angeline: "Angeline"
 angeline_religion_desc: "Angelines live very different lives from their Ursuline counterparts. Whereas the Ursulines emphasize the monastic lifestyle and the primacy of the Church, Angelines more strongly emphasize cohabitation with the secular world."

 anabaptist_religion_desc: "The Anabaptists are a branch of Christianity originating from 16th century Europe, and the forebears of American groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites, which banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world. Anabaptists believe Christians should remain separate from the rest of the world, refuse to hold office and refrain from violence even in war or self-defence, tenets which make life after the apocalypse difficult, and often quite short."
 evangelical: "Evangelical"
 evangelical_religion_desc: "The Evangelical Church is what remains of antediluvian Protestantism. In the face of post-deluge upheavals, the Protestant churches banded together, putting aside minor theological differences in favor of establishing an Evangelical Convention of Churches presided over by an ecumenical council of bishops."

 antinomian: "Antinomian"
 antinomian_religion_desc: "Antinomianism is a theological doctrine which predates the apocalypse, and takes the Protestant notion of 'sola fide'- salvation by 'faith alone'- to its extreme, rejecting not just Old Testament ceremonial laws but all of the laws laid down by Moses. This rejection of Mosaic law- or 'moral law'- absolutely drives mainstream Protestantism nuts and has been a thorny issue since the days of Martin Luther."
 postadventist: "Postadventist"
 postadventist_religion_desc: "Postadventists believe that the Second Coming has already happened, that Jesus came to judge the living and the dead... and was not pleased."
 charismatic: "Charismatic"
 charismatic_religion_desc: "Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief in 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs that can be endowed simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Such wonders include the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered 'supernatural'."
 occultist: "Occultist"
 occultist_religion_desc: "Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers.

 occultist_reformed: "Occultist"
 occultist_reformed_religion_desc: "Occultist followers believe that the universe is a vast mystery, with the dark corners of reality holding innumerable secrets and dangers.

 oldworld: "Old World Cultist"
 atomicist: "Atomicist"
 atomicist_religion_desc: "Atomicists worship elements of old world technology and hold sacred the places 'touched by the Almighty Atom'. Although atomic theory is practically forgotten, Atomicists understand that there is an invisible world out there which houses vast power. If they could but find a way to tap into this intangible world, they believe they would become gods themselves! The tumors and radiation sickness, though, they don't talk about as much."
 americanist: "Americanist"
 americanist_religion_desc: "Americanists worship what must have been the true gods of the old world-- the statues of Father Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and others clearly indicates who the ancient Americans worshipped. Those Americans built a great empire, so why not follow their beliefs and build America again, gods and all?" 
 hamiltonian: "Hamiltonian"
 hamiltonian_religion_desc: "Hamiltonians differ from mainstream Americanism in that they take their faith in the gods of the Old World to a higher level. Legends outline the gods' abilities and deeds, but Hamiltonians believe the gods had more powers beyond those explicitly stated. They hold, furthermore, that it is within the capabilities of all believers to attain these 'implied powers' for themselves."
 jeffersonian: "Jeffersonian"
 jeffersonian_religion_desc: "The old legends speak not of just Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln, but also of the farmers, the soldiers, and all the common men of the Old World. As widespread as the statues of the Founders are, are there not statues of the common infantryman in many old towns? What of the farmers and the grand grange halls they established? Jeffersonians hold that the Americanist gods of the old world were just a few of many, and that the entire nation of ancient America was home to gods. All the land was blessed by the gods, therefore, and thus all the land must be reclaimed by the true faith!"
 libertarian: "Libertarian"
 libertarian_religion_desc: "The devoted of Lady Liberty, the Mother of Old America and the Goddess of Freedom, the Libertarians were once a matriarchal Patriotic order of the Americanists dedicated to the defence and restoration of the Statues of Liberty who broke from Washington in protest against the 'overemphasis' of the Founders over Lady Liberty. In the centuries since the continued revelation and dedicated study of the First Lady and her Justices have lead the libertarians and the Americanists to opposite positions on a vast number of theological points, from the approved methods of establishing proof of presidential deification after death all the way to structure of the old world pantheon."
 rust_cultist: "Rust Cultist"
 rust_cultist_religion_desc: "When the first of the Rust Cult stumbled upon an abandoned factory of the old world, what he saw seemed to be the handiwork of the gods. The cult quickly spread through the former Rust Belt, worshipping these houses of the divine and the technological marvels wrought within, which they are willing to defend with their lives.

Due to their age however, opportunities to find operational relics are few and far between."

 rust_cultist_reformed_religion_desc: "When the first of the Rust Cult stumbled upon an abandoned factory of the old world, what he saw seemed to be the handiwork of the gods. The cult quickly spread through the former Rust Belt, worshipping these houses of the divine and the technological marvels wrought within, which they are willing to defend with their lives. Rust Cultists dedicate much of their time to recovering and revering any old world technology they can find. Due to their age however, opportunities to find operational relics are few and far between. They have now structured their faith, allowing them full access to mainstream succession laws, as well as the option to wage grand holy wars."
 rastafarian: "Rastafarian"

 voodoo_religion_desc: "Descended from West African Vodun, Voodoo originated in 18th century Haiti, spreading later to Louisiana. Vodouists worship the creator god Bondye, but as he is unreachable they pray to his servants, the Loa, who act as intermediaries in exchange for service. Each Loa is responsible for a different aspect of life, and vodouists develop a personal relationship with them through elaborate ceremonies that can include ritual offerings, song, dance, and allowing themselves to be possessed by the spirits so that Loa and vodouist may communicate."
 afro_syncretic: "Afro-Syncretic"
 catholic_religion_desc: "Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. The Papacy is now located in old St. Louis, as contact with Rome was lost. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of New Rome - the Pope."
 santeria: "Santería"
 santeria_religion_desc: "Santería, translating roughly to 'devotion to the saints', is an Afro-Cuban religion that can be traced back to the Yoruba people of West Africa. Believers worship three aspects of one god, Olodumaré the Creator, Olorun, who manifests as the Sun, and Olofi, who directly communicates with the Orichás - or "Saints" - and grants them spiritual energy to act as intermediaries between man and God, as well as to help mankind live moral, harmonious lives."

 gracia_divina: "Gracia Divina"
 gracia_divina_religion_desc: "The adherents of Gracia Divina hold belief in the karma like system of 'divine grace'. They believe that the greater piety and devoutness shown in life, the more fortunate their lives will become, that they literally become graced by the divine. They believe especially that devotion to specific saints/deities (the terms have been interchangeable in Gracia Divina) will lead to that Saint becoming their patron, and directly influence their lives. This can lead to very zealous devotion as the worshipper takes on an extremely personal and intimate connection with their patron."
 espiritista: "Espiritista"
 espiritista_religion_desc: "The Espiritista faithful believe that good and evil spirits inhabit our world, with the powers to affect health, luck, and other aspects of human life. These spirits can be contacted by trained mediums. There is a Supreme God, but under him are the three powers: mortals who have ascended to the level of deities: María Lionza, Negro Felipe, and Guaicaipuro. Beneath the three powers are the spirits: numerous powerful mortals who continue to influence the world after their deaths. These spirits are organized into roughly 21 courts, which believers can petition for aid through prayer."
 falling_star: "Falling Star"
 falling_star_religion_desc: "Sometime either during or just after the Apocalypse, the faith of the Falling Star believe a star fell from the heavens and onto Earth. This star was a fallen Angel, who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. Practitioners of the Falling Star faith are generally viewed with suspicion by those with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels are generally thought of as evil, and associated with Satan. However, the Falling Star faith insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, members of the Fallen Star still fall under the Christian banner, albeit with a theology that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."
 american_native: "American Native"
 ghost_dance: "Nanissáanah"
 ghost_dance_religion_desc: "Nanissáanah, known as the 'Ghost Dance', is a syncretic, reformed form of more traditional Plains Indian beliefs.

Raven indirectly made the world by stealing and transforming that which came before, and preserved the Haida though the Dark Times with cleverness and trickery. Other Xhúuyee K'iigaang gods include Ta'xet and Tia, who rule respectively over violent and peaceful death."
 latter_day_saints: "Latter-Day Saints"
 mormon: "Mormon"
 mormon_religion_desc: "With roots in Ancient America's frontier, Mormonism has a solid hold on many parts of the Old West. Although based in Christian foundations, the Church of Latter-Day Saints has many additional books, customs and traditions which have caused it to be treated differently from some elements of mainstream Christianity. With the chaos of the apocalypse, these attitudes were exacerbated, and Mormonism is widely treated as a wholly distinct realm from the Christian world of New Rome and the Protestantism of the East."

 bickertonite_religion_desc: "The Bickertonite faithful consider themselves the true continuation of the Mormon faith, following the events of the calamity. The Bickertonites believe that they have a sacred duty to share the gift of salvation with people of every race, and refuse to engage in plural marriage as practiced by other LDS sects."
 godbeite: "Godbeite"
 godbeite_religion_desc: "The Godbeites have diverse mystical beliefs and practices considered heretical by the Mormon church. Though few Godbeite believers have existed since the calamity, from time to time their surviving writings in favor of reform and against plural marriage are discovered and spur a revival of the sect."
 strangite: "Strangite"
 strangite_religion_desc: "The Strangites believe James Strang to be the lawful successor of Joseph Smith, and consider the historical leaders of the Mormon church to be heretics. Strangites allow the ordination of women into the priesthood and reject the notion of the trinity (believing that there is only one God, and that Jesus was born an ordinary mortal). Animal sacrifice is common, and devout farmers make an offering of the "Firstfruit" of the harvest."
 pirate: "Pirate"
 brethren: "Brethren"
 brethren_religion_desc: "With a strong tradition of seafaring and a reputation for robbery and murder, most call the Brethren pirates. This assessment is not far from the truth. Though the Brethren follow a Code of the Sea, they are loosely organized and live mostly to plunder riches from the weak. All of their gods have some link to the ocean, which they consider the source of all life and all wealth."
 gaian: "Gaian"
 gaian_religion_desc: "Gaians worship numerous spirits of nature, Gaia foremost among them. Also known as Earth Mother, the Goddess, or Primordia, the faithful believe Gaia is a divine spirit interconnected with all living things... the ancient soul of the Earth itself. Gaian theology encourages a society ruled by women rather than men, teaching that man neglected the world and that it was his disregard for the natural balance that led the Earth to ruin."
 cetic: "Cetic"
 cetic_religion_desc: "The Cetic faith involves the study of philosophical writings by a number of Great Teachers (Gurus), including the Emperor, Buddha, Christ, and Hubbard. Adherents seek enlightenment through meditation and discussion of the writings. The first Emperor of California formally organized the faith with secular and religious power deeply intertwined within the imperial title, and the head of the faith is traditionally chosen from among his descendants."
 nousthreskeia: "Nousthreskeia"
 nousthreskeia_religion_desc: "The central tenet of Nousthreskeia is the concept of the \"Noosphere\", an invisible field that surrounds the Earth and is affected by the collective minds and thoughts of humanity. Followers of Nousthriskeia believe that the Noosphere is capable of altering both the collective human consciousness and physical reality itself, and that the Event was the result of artificial interference with the Noosphere. This interference damaged the Noosphere, knocking the physical world and the consciousness of humanity back to a more primitive state. Nousthristkeists believe that humanity will not recover from the Event until this damage to the Noosphere has been healed and that a \"Wish Granter\" exists somewhere in the world that can accomplish this goal almost instantaneously if found and used properly."
 candomble: "Candomblé"
 candomble_religion_desc: "Candomblé literally means 'dance in honor of the gods,' and as is to be expected from the name many rituals involve music and dance.

Candomblé is a syncretic faith that absorbed religious traditions from West Africans, Portuguese Catholics, and indigenous South Americans."

 zanahary_religion_desc:0 "Zanahary the Creator has a dual nature; both male and female, Light and Dark, Heaven and Earth. The Ancestors are the most important members of the community, as they stand in direct contact with the divine, while the living are merely a temporary extension."
 presbyterian:0 "Presbyterian"
 presbyterian_religion_desc:0 "Presbyterian church"
 reform_faith:0 "Reform"
 reform_faith_religion_desc:0 "Reform Judaism first split from Orthodox Judaism in the 19th century, under the belief that in order for Judaism to survive in the modern age, it should reform to be more compatible with a modern, secular lifestyle. Reform Judaism regards Halacha (Jewish religious law) as non-binding, permits women to be ordained as rabbis, and is overall more open to external influences than Orthodx Judaism."
 monetarist:0 "Monetarist"
 monetarist_religion_desc:0 "Monetarists split from Consumerists over a disagreement as to the correct way to honor the Almighty Dollar. Monetarists reject the Consumerist ritual of retail therapy and reverance of the Invisible Hand and hold that the Almighty Dollar is best served by the accumulation of wealth."

However, schisms have began to develop within the National Mall. The prevailing interpretation of the Prophet's Catalog is that followers should strive to amass wealth so that they can buy more goods and placate the Invisible Hand, but a new sect called the Monetarists has emerged which challenges this. They argue that the accumulation of wealth is an end in itself, and that spending it profanes the Almighty Dollar. Though mainstream Consumerists have rejected this doctrine as heresy, many rulers and priests have professed their allegiance to the Monetarist doctrine, and the schism threatens to divide the whole Consumerist world."

 canada.EVTNAME1: "The Canadian Wedding"
 canada.EVTDESC1: "[root.getname], King of Québéc, was married to Princess [root.getname] of Ontario in [GetYear]. The princess and heir to Ontario was in a precarious position, and needed outside help to deal with rebellious vassals. The court of Québéc saw an opportunity for expansion, and a way to end the constant skirmishes with one of their neighbours. King [root.getname] would proceed to spend much of his reign putting down rebellions in Ontario, both from Ontarian nobles attempting to press their claims to the throne and from peasant unrest instigated by the religious authorities of the kingdom. Rumours of all kind spread like wildfire, including assertions that the King and Queen hated each other, claims that Queen [root.getname] took other women to bed when King [root.getname] was away, and other, altogether darker rumours. Many hold King [root.getname] in high regard for bringing unity to the long separate realms. Others see his name as a curse, considering him nothing more than a foreign conqueror with queer customs and a strange religion."

 flavor_NYS.1.TITLE: "A Christian Republic"
 flavor_NYS.1.DESC: "Following the Holy Columbian conquest of Gotham in 2996, the city of Manhattan and its surrounding areas were placed under the direct control of the Emperor, with the other areas of Gotham being parceled out to other Southern houses. This new state of affairs greatly disrupted the business of the patrician houses of the City, who were robbed of the commercial privileges they had granted themselves under the Republic of New York. Even worse, Confederate laws for conquered territory restricted property-ownership rights to Christians, leaving the Americanist great families of Manhattan liable to have their wealth confiscated. The patricians of New York quickly chose gold over Gods, converting to Christianity, spending lavishly on gaudy new Cathedrals and competing with one another to see who could proclaim their love of God and His gospel the loudest. The point of these displays was not to gain the love of God, but rather the love of the Emperor. And at last in 3001, after receiving countless petitions, gifts, and proclamation of loyalty, the Emperor relented and gave the city extensive privileges and liberties, proclaiming the Confederate Christian Republic of New York. The republic swiftly returned to its former glory, reclaiming much of its original possessions through guile, bribery, and the occasional open war. Now the preeminent commercial center on the Eastern Seaboard, it is tradition for newly elected Consuls of New York to re-pledge their allegiance to Christ and the Confederacy before entering office, as a reminder of the deal that bought them their freedom."

Shortly afterwards, they brought into custody a young man found in a nearby alley struggling to get out of a tight-fitting red mummer’s costume, with a coil of rope in his possession. Our officers have identified him as one Peter Parquagh, though he insists on calling himself “The Gentile Neighborhood Spider-man”.

However, such good fortune invites jealous neighbors, and §YOntario§! must contend with the strong American states of §YMichigan§!, §YOhio§!, and §YHudsonia§!, as well as the vicious §YMetis§! horde on its western frontier. \n \n§YOntario§! follows the §YHigh Church§! faith, a branch of §YChristianity§! that developed out of protestant traditions in Anglophone Canada.

After all, it was here that stood the great stone monuments to Lincoln, Washington, and liberty itself. Yet as the influence of paganism waned across the continent, the §YAmericanist§! states of the §YNortheast§! found themselves beset upon by Christians from all directions. The Crusade of 2996 sealed their fate, as the §YConfederate§! Emperor led a massive invasion of the §YNortheast§!. The conquered lands were parceled out to his loyal subjects in the §YConfederacy§!, and §YEvangelical Christianity§! was made the official religion of the land in keeping with the rest of the §YConfederacy§!. Yet people do not change their ways so quickly, and much of the peasantry in the region still adhere to the old ways.  \n \nWhile their forced incorporation into the §YConfederacy§! was a painful process for many in the region, coming under the protection of the §YEmperor§! has allowed its various small states to maintain their independence despite such close proximity to powers such as §YHudsonia§!, §YOhio§!, and the §YRedcoats§!. \n \nIn the years since the conquest, political marriages and feudal conflicts have seen the occasional old crusader exiled to the lands gifted to them in the crusade: thus the §YLongroads§! of §YShenadoah§! control only §YLong Island§! after being exiled from §YShenadoah§! itself by the §YDuke of Piedmont§!. Others have retained their possessions, and the dukes of §YBlue Ridge§! in the §YAppalachians§! still control the county of §YPocomoke§! in §YMaryland§!.

 string_start_new_york:0 "Following the Holy Columbian conquest of Gotham in 2996, the city of Manhattan and its surrounding areas were placed under the direct control of the Emperor, with the other areas of Gotham being parceled out to other Southern houses. This new state of affairs greatly disrupted the business of the patrician houses of the City, who were robbed of the commercial privileges they had granted themselves under the Republic of New York. Even worse, Confederate laws for conquered territory restricted property-ownership rights to Christians, leaving the Americanist great families of Manhattan liable to have their wealth confiscated. The patricians of New York quickly chose gold over Gods, converting to Christianity, spending lavishly on gaudy new Cathedrals, and competing with one another to see who could proclaim their love of God and His gospel the loudest. The point of these displays was not to gain the love of God, but rather the love of the Emperor. At last, in 3001, after receiving countless petitions, gifts, and proclamations of loyalty, the Emperor relented and gave the city extensive privileges and liberties, proclaiming the Confederate Christian Republic of New York. The republic swiftly returned to its former glory, reclaiming much of its original possessions through guile, bribery, and the occasional open war. Now the preeminent commercial center on the Eastern Seaboard, it is tradition for newly elected Consuls of New York to re-pledge their allegiance to Christ and the Confederacy before entering office, as a reminder of the deal that bought them their freedom."

The §YWaltneys§! control most of the §YFloridian peninsula§!, as well the banks of the §YSavannah River§!, thanks to an opportune political marriage. Such political marriages were common throughout the §YConfederacy’s§! history, and in 3053 many of its princes claim control of lands far separated from their seats of power.
