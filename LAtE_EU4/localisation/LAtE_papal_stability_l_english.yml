 papal_stability.1.t:0 "Ordinate Contact"
 papal_stability.1.pope.d:0 "While the schismatic Ordinate sect had split off from the Catholic Church in the dark ages, the same distance between their heartland of Quebec and our Catholic Christendom that justified their abandonment of our Church also meant that, while a blow to the Church, it practically wasn't really a problem. Those Catholic faithful who had the most contact with the Ordinates were zealous in their Catholic practices and faith as they were on the frontlines of constant religious war with the Rust Cultists and Norse of the Great Lakes, and thus were deaf to the siren songs of those heretics. However, with the end of widespread religious war due to the Ordinate conquest of Michigan and the resulting cornering of the Rust Cultists and the happenstance stagnation of the Norse, there is much more contact between our worlds.\n \nAlready, closer proximity to these schismatics and reduced fervor compared to their forefathers leads catholic faithful across Christendom and even church clergy to fall astray to their dissident ways of thinking. Whispers can be heard all across the Catholic world, even in the halls of the Apostolic Palace, the most radical of which call for a church without bishops, without cardinals, and even without a pope. These words are inspired by the clearly falsified stories of unfortunately real and 'achieved' societies, those of the heretic Ordinates, that still follow something resembling the Catholic orthodoxy without the supposed 'frivolities' of the Catholic Church's hierarchy, and somehow even without worry of descending into the various paganisms most of post-event America had. Suffice to say, the stability of the Catholic Church and the Papal States have been called into question as a consequence.\n \nWith the Catholic world slowly growing suspicious of it's clergy, Catholic Christendom may reach a breaking point in the near future."

 papal_stability.1.ursuline.d:0 "During the ages that preceded the glorious conquest of the strait and southern peninsula our religious society had learned how to operate with the lack of connection with the seat of the Church. The Sororal Orders set the path towards sainthood straight as the rulers of their flock. Even more so with the heretics and pagans frolicking and fornicating beyond the waters of the Great Lakes.\n For one of these dysmorphic apparitions has made itself known to us after the Crusade, the people past the waters who have managed to hold on to a semblance of our pure teachings have revealed themselves egocentric and heretical, having ordained a false bishop the title of the long gone Holy Father. \n These stillborn-fraternal twins of ours have kept scripture, but failed morally in appointing a successor, placing themselves somewhere only God should, it is fair now that with our good influence the best of the missing flock will rejoin the light of our Creator."

 papal_stability.2.t:0 "Loss of Chicago"
 papal_stability.2.d:0 "Under the winds of time all fears of man come true. For once more this has realized itself, as the bastion of the Church in the lakes has fallen.\n The city from which once hailed many popes and whose broad shoulders supported our temples has been swept from the will of the Catholic Kings, the temples undone and the priests expelled.\n Truly the expulsion of the will of the Pope from the lakes is whispered even by the most zealous as a great set back for us.\n The desires and plans of God are truly mysterious and the faithful question the direction of our current Father-Bishop."
 papal_stability.2.a:0 "Oh Lord, Why did you take the White City from us?"
 papal_stability.3.t:0 "Chicago Reclaimed"
 papal_stability.3.d:0 "The same winds of time that God gives for his children placing them under darkness give them also the direction towards light.\n For thus it also is so in the case of Chicago, as the faithful have reclaimed it from the clutches of darkness, truly our Lord is gracious and a shepherd to his children.\n In the absent light we were protected, had time to get ready and renew our faith, be less complacent, and in the right time return towards the light. \n The desires and plans of God are truly mysterious, but we the faithful are here on this earth to obey Him and our Father-Bishop."
