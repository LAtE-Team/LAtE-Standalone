 anabaptists_estate_events.2.t: "Anabaptist Influence Expands"
 anabaptists_estate_events.2.d: "Many influential Anabaptists have found a home in the court of [Root.Country.GetName]. Anabaptist ascetics, builders, and merchants alike have the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. There are even rumors that [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has joined in Anabaptist rituals. Though a small religious minority, the Anabaptists are gaining power in politics and society."
 anabaptists_estate_events.3.t: "Anabaptist Influence Declines"
 anabaptists_estate_events.3.d: "The Anabaptists once again find themselves lacking in social capital. Prominent ascetics have managed to get themselves exiled from court following a series of religious and political disagreements, and Anabaptist merchants find their fortunes are waning. Anabaptist influence is on the decline."
 anabaptists_estate_events.3.a: "Accept"
 anabaptists_estate_events.4.t: "Anabaptists Resist Persecution"
 anabaptists_estate_events.4.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName] have become utterly disloyal following many acts of disrespect and persecution by the state. The situation has become great exacerbated by an outrageous act of sacrilege. One of our [Root.Religion.GetName] governors marched into a Anabaptist temple, slaughtered a cow, and desecrated the noses of all the icons inside. Unwilling to accept further persecution, the Anabaptist community has resolved to oppose our government. Their methods of resistance are unorthodox yet effective; rather than rising up in violent rebellion they boycott institutions of state, and refuse all participation in government. Our reliance on the Anabaptist community has become a damning vulnerability."
 anabaptists_estate_events.4.a: "At least they are pacifists."
 anabaptists_estate_events.5.t: "Anabaptists Abandon Construction"
 anabaptists_estate_events.5.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName] have become utterly disloyal following many acts of disrespect and persecution by the state. Due to the violent nature of our state they have begun to refuse to participate in common construction projects. Our reliance on the Anabaptist community has become a damning vulnerability."
 anabaptists_estate_events.5.a: "At least they are pacifists."
 anabaptists_estate_events.6.t: "Anabaptists Retreat"
 anabaptists_estate_events.6.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName] have become utterly disloyal following many acts of disrespect and persecution by the state. Due to the perceived backward practices of our religion they have begun to retreat into their own communities. This has greatly reduced the productive capacities of affected areas. Our reliance on the Anabaptist community has become a damning vulnerability."
 anabaptists_estate_events.6.a: "At least they are pacifists."
 anabaptists_estate_events.7.t: "Anabaptists Volunteering"
 anabaptists_estate_events.7.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName], happy with the policies of the state, have begun to give charities to the lay communities. This has greatly increased the growth in affected areas. Our reliance on the Anabaptist community continues to be a benefit."
 anabaptists_estate_events.7.a: "Those lovely pacifists."
 anabaptists_estate_events.8.t: "Anabaptists Integrate"
 anabaptists_estate_events.8.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName], happy with the policies of the state, have begun to give integrate into our communities.

 anabaptists_estate_events.9.t: "Anabaptists Offer Church"
 anabaptists_estate_events.9.d: "The Anabaptist community of [Root.Country.GetName], happy with the policies of the state, have offered to help construct a temple. Though we would still have to cover materials, the labour would be entirely free. This could be a great opportunity."
 anabaptists_estate_events.9.a: "We accept."
 anabaptists_estate_events.9.b: "Not right now."
 anabaptists_estate_events.10.t: "Anabaptistism on Trial"
 anabaptists_estate_events.10.d: "While Christian religions can be tolerated, there is no place in [Root.Country.GetName] for heathens who do not partake in communion. The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has charged the Anabaptists with being heathens, due to their strange practices, and have held a debate before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to settle the matter.\n\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ argue that the Anabaptists refuse the infant baptism and the participation in the Christian state.\n\nThe Anabaptist monks present at the debate fervently repudiate this view. Opting for flexibility, they put forth a multitude of Anabaptist doctrines to demonstrate their true faith in the lord Jesus.\n\nUltimately, it falls upon the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to decide the fate of Anabaptistism in [Root.Country.GetName]. We must consider which argument we find most compelling."
 anabaptists_estate_events.10.a: "The Anabaptists are Christians, as we are."
 anabaptists_estate_events.10.b: "The Anabaptists are heathens, they are not in communion."

 anabaptists_estate_events.11.t: "Anabaptists Demand Religious Concessions"
 anabaptists_estate_events.11.d: "Representatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] Anabaptist community appear before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal; cement the status of Anabaptistism in both state and society in exchange for the undying loyalty of the community. They mean to achieve this status through the enactment of policies granting religious concessions. These would include the prohibition of animal slaughter, ending the confiscation of the property of the deceased, abolishing religious taxes, and the release of political prisoners with ties to prominent Anabaptist families.\n\nThese proposals have been met with outrage from the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy, and are likely to be unpopular throughout the realm. It may be time to sever our close alliance with the Anabaptists."
 anabaptists_estate_events.11.a: "Agree to the concessions."
 anabaptists_estate_events.11.b: "They have gone too far. Time to cut ties."
 EST_VAL_ANA_RELIGIOUS_CONCESSIONS: "Major Religious Concessions: §Y$VAL$%§!"

 anabaptists_estate_events.12.t: "Anabaptists Request Privileges"
 anabaptists_estate_events.12.d: "The Anabaptists living in our provinces have requested certain privileges, first among them to not engage in any sort of violence, in exchange for living under out rule."
 anabaptists_estate_events.12.a: "They are welcome to stay"
 anabaptists_estate_events.12.b: "We will make no such deal"
 anabaptists_estate_events.13.t: "The Anabaptist Community Grows in [Root.GetName]"
 anabaptists_estate_events.13.d: "The Anabaptist community in [Root.GetName] has grown significantly. If we do nothing they will both pose a greater threat to stability in our realm, while giving us further potential to benefit from their labour. How should we respond to this?"
 anabaptists_estate_events.13.a: "We will grow together"
 anabaptists_estate_events.13.b: "We must stop this growth at once"
 anabaptists_estate_events.14.t: "Anabaptist Conversion in [Root.GetName]"
 anabaptists_estate_events.14.d: "Due to our policies the Anabaptists have begun converting people in [Root.GetName]. Unless we step in now it is unlikely that populace will resist their preachers."
 anabaptists_estate_events.14.a: "This must be God's will"
 anabaptists_estate_events.14.b: "We must do everything we can to stop this"
 anabaptists_estate_events.15.t: "The Anabaptist Community Shrinks in [Root.GetName]"
 anabaptists_estate_events.15.d: "The Anabaptist community in [Root.GetName] has shrunk significantly due to their perceived persecution. In particular they cite our intolerance of their pacifism, via our army and tax officers, as well as our general heathenous nature. They have mostly set off to try and find another monarch who might treat them better."
 anabaptists_estate_events.15.a: "Good Riddance!"
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.t: "Anabaptists Request Shelter"
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.d: "The Anabaptists of [FROM.GetName] have fled to our provinces to escape persecution. Because of tolerance we have already shown their kind, they are expecting to be able to settle in our lands with all rights and privileges we have afford their community."
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.d.long: "The Anabaptists of [FROM.GetName] have fled to our provinces to escape persecution. Because of our shared faith in Christ they hope to be allowed to stay and continue to practice their religion. They are willing to offer us their meager possessions in exchange for these privileges."
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.a: "They are welcome to stay"
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.b: "We have no need of them"
 anabaptists_estate_events.16.c: "We will never have need of them"

 #Cowboys
 cossack_raids_opinion: "Cossack Raids"
 cowboys_estate_events.1.t: "Colonization of the Steppes"
 cowboys_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ complain that an increasing number of serfs are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the Cossacks of the Steppes. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the Cossacks to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the Cossacks so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."
 cowboys_estate_events.1.a: "These Serfs must be brought back."
 cowboys_estate_events.1.b: "We cannot afford to anger the Cossacks."
 cowboys_estate_events.2.t: "Cossack Aggression"
 cowboys_estate_events.2.d: "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback, the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came. Both the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have interests in the affected areas and both groups now demand that we do something."

Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders.

The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ have interests in the affected areas and demand that we do something."
 cowboys_estate_events.2.d.fallback: "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback, the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came. Our local authorities in the affected areas are now demanding that we do something."
 cowboys_estate_events.2.a: "Demand that these Cossacks be brought to Justice!"
 cowboys_estate_events.2.b: "We will just have to let this slide."
 cowboys_estate_events.3.t: "Cossack Aggression"
 cowboys_estate_events.3.d: "Moving quickly by boat or on horseback the Cossacks of the steppes are very adept raiders. Several such raids have lately laid waste to the [From.GetAdjective] countryside and even major cities some way from our borders.\nAs the Cossacks responsible are based inside our borders the [From.GetAdjective] have now demanded both compensation and for the culprits to be brought to justice."
 cowboys_estate_events.3.a: "This matter is beyond our control."
 cowboys_estate_events.3.b: "Bring them to justice!"
 cowboys_estate_events.4.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"
 cowboys_estate_events.4.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response is that they refuse to take responsibility for the raids into our country, claiming that they are unable to control the Cossacks themselves."
 cowboys_estate_events.4.a: "We care little for such excuses."
 cowboys_estate_events.5.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"
 cowboys_estate_events.5.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] response has been to send some monetary compensation for the raids of their Cossack subjects which has made up for the damage to property. They also claim that they have brought the guilty parties to justice."
 cowboys_estate_events.5.a: "If we could only believe that."
 cowboys_estate_events.6.t: "Growth of Cossacks Power"
 cowboys_estate_events.6.d: "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the Cossacks have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately, however, things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their settlements and their services to the state as raiders are indisputable."
 cowboys_estate_events.6.a: "Ok."
 cowboys_estate_events.7.t: "Decline of Cossacks Power"
 cowboys_estate_events.7.d: "The free nature of the Cossacks and the distance between them and the halls of power in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has always been a problem for them. Lacking hereditary privileges the number of Cossacks registered with the state as officers with the benefits that entail have been decreasing steadily."
 cowboys_estate_events.7.a: "Ok."
 cowboys_estate_events.8.t: "Petition for Privileges"
 cowboys_estate_events.8.d: "Not all Cossacks are awarded the same privileges by the state. Traditionally rights are awarded to specific Cossacks that are willing to perform great services to the state in times of war. As these rights are not transferable upon death this means that the influence of the Cossacks can vary greatly over time. According to the Cossacks it is high time we grant them further privileges to bolster our numbers."
 cowboys_estate_events.8.a: "We need more registered Cossacks!"
 cowboys_estate_events.8.b: "Let them tend to their Steppes."
 cowboys_estate_events.9.t: "Supplies for the Cossacks"
 cowboys_estate_events.9.d: "Life on the frontier can be harsh and while the Cossacks are used to fighting their own battles a little help from the central treasury could probably be put to good use. Last season was unusually harsh and together with an increasing number of Tatar incursions many Cossacks now have an urgent shortage of food for the coming months. If we were to supply the Cossacks with grain as well as military supplies such as arms and uniforms we would not only be strengthening our defenders on the Steppes directly we would likely also tie them closer to our state."
 cowboys_estate_events.9.a: "Send them what they need."
 cowboys_estate_events.9.b: "They'll have to make do themselves."
 cowboys_estate_events.10.t: "Grain Trade Disturbances"
 cowboys_estate_events.10.d: "There has always been tension between the Cossacks and the other estates, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately, however, these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the Cossacks raids and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain. The Cossacks themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."
 cowboys_estate_events.10.a: "Support the Cossacks."
 cowboys_estate_events.10.b: "Support the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 cowboys_estate_events.11.t: "Cossack Settlers in [cossack_settlers_province.GetName]"
 cowboys_estate_events.11.d: "The life of the Steppes has made the Cossacks used to a frontier living. Constant threats from both a harsh climate in an unsettled land and of Tartar raiders have made the Cossacks both feared warriors and hardy settlers.\nAs we turn our sights on the land of [cossack_settlers_province.GetName] it is becoming apparent that life on the eastern frontier is not that different from that of the Steppes we already control."
 cowboys_estate_events.11.a: "Enlist Cossacks Settlers."
 cowboys_estate_events.11.b: "We cannot trust the Cossacks."
 cowboys_estate_events.12.t: "Unrest among the Cossacks"
 cowboys_estate_events.12.d: "The deep distrust of the Cossacks for the state in general and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in particular has culminated in a total breakdown of authority on the steppes. The communities of the Cossacks are openly hostile to our emissaries and de facto now act entirely independent from central authority."
 cowboys_estate_events.12.a: "Leave them alone, relations will improve in due time."
 cowboys_estate_events.12.b: "Crush the dissenters."
 cowboys_estate_events.13.t: "Cossack Expansion in [growing_cossack_communities.GetName]"
 cowboys_estate_events.13.d: "Borders can often be theoretical things, especially in the wild fields. It seems the Cossacks have expanded rapidly into [growing_cossack_communities.GetName]. We could attempt to reverse this development but the Cossacks would likely not take kindly to being removed from land they have worked hard to settle."
 cowboys_estate_events.13.a: "Accept the new Status Quo."
 cowboys_estate_events.13.b: "Reclaim the land from the Cossacks."
 cowboys_estate_events.14.t: "Demands for Extended Privileges"
 cowboys_estate_events.14.d: "The old dream of the Cossacks has always been to be accepted as the equals to the established estates such as the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Never has this dream been closer to realization than now. The Cossacks have achieved great influence in our state and in many ways we rely on their support.\nGiven the favorable circumstances many Cossacks are now voicing their old demands for official recognition and privileges."
 cowboys_estate_events.14.a: "Preposterous."
 cowboys_estate_events.14.b: "Give in to their demands."
 cowboys_estate_events.15.t: "[Root.GetName] Cossacks Revolt"

 cowboys_estate_events.15.a: "Ok."
 cowboys_estate_events.16.t: "Wavering Loyalty of the Cossacks"
 cowboys_estate_events.16.d: "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the Cossacks grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of Cossacks leaders in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 cowboys_estate_events.16.a: "Ok."

 scavengers_estate_events.1.d: "The status of the $ESTATE_SCAVENGERS$ does not rest on the privileges of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ or the wealth of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by cunning and bravery. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. Recent sites have borne much fruit, and this windfall has greatly increased their influence"

 EST_VAL_SCAVENGERS_ADVANCE: "Advancement of Scavenger Influence: §Y$VAL$%§!"
 scavengers_estate_events.2.t: "Decline of Scavenger Influence"
 scavengers_estate_events.2.d: "Without either the old privileges and pedigrees or sheer economical power of other factions the status and influence of the $ESTATE_SCAVENGERS$ is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power. Lately a combination of failed excursions and misdirected political ambitions have resulted in a loss of power and influence for the $ESTATE_SCAVENGERS$ of [Root.GetName]."

 scavengers_estate_events.3.d: "It is no doubt that $ESTATE_SCAVENGERS$ experience much more adversity than the average solider. Exploring dangerous and uncharted ruins is by no means an easy task, and quickly teaches many lessons. Some have suggested taking on $ESTATE_SCAVENGERS$ as officers and command within our forces to make use of their wide breadth of knowledge, though others warn that their irregular upbringing into war may cause our army to suffer professionally."

 #Antiquarians
 antiquarians_estate_events.1.t: "Libertas Ecclesiae"
 antiquarians_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services no ecclesiastical manor, monastery or other estate pay any taxes to the state and the temporal authorities do not meddle in the internal affairs of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 antiquarians_estate_events.1.a: "Make it clear that they need to contribute."
 antiquarians_estate_events.1.b: "We will find the money elsewhere."
 antiquarians_estate_events.2.t: "Advancement of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$"
 antiquarians_estate_events.2.d: "The power of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ has never relied on the state itself. Rather it is in many ways the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ who through their ties to the spiritual realm lend their legitimacy to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A combination of deft political maneuvering, perceived bad omens and generous donations from our subjects have lately cemented the power of this estate."
 antiquarians_estate_events.2.a: "Ok."
 antiquarians_estate_events.3.t: "$ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ losing Power"
 antiquarians_estate_events.3.d: "More than any other Estate the influence of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ is dependent on their standing with the common man. It has been hard to put the finger at exactly why but over the recent years the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ has come to be seen less as the spiritual guardians of our country and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers. Combined with some unfortunate investments in the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ properties themselves and poor political maneuvering the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ have been losing both power and influence."
 antiquarians_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."
 antiquarians_estate_events.4.t: "Anticlericalism"
 antiquarians_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_UNIONS$ of several prominent cities are accusing the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ of being greedy and indolent. The pious commoners are now withholding the tithe in a protest against a particularly bad example of misuse of the authority of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$. Pious $ESTATE_UNIONS$ are now objecting to paying tithes to the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ as they consider the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ unfit to receive them.\nThe $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ are furious and demand that we fine the obstinate $ESTATE_UNIONS$."
 antiquarians_estate_events.4.d.2: "The $ESTATE_UNIONS$ of several prominent cities are accusing the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ of being greedy and indolent. The pious commoners are now withholding the tithe in a protest against a particularly bad example of misuse of the authority of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$. Pious $ESTATE_UNIONS$ are now objecting to paying tithes to the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ as they consider the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ unfit to receive them.\nThe $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ are furious and demand that we fine the obstinate $ESTATE_UNIONS$."

 antiquarians_estate_events.4.b: "A mild reprimand will be enough."
 antiquarians_estate_events.5.t: "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$"
 antiquarians_estate_events.5.d: "Relations between the state and the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ has now sunk low enough that it is entirely characterized by distrust and even open defiance. The Holy Places of our nation are centers of resistance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and most of the faithful in our lands are doubting the legitimacy of our rule.\nWith things as they are it comes as no surprise that all it took for the situation to ignite was one small misstep by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] during a religious ceremony last week. The peasants are now rising all over our country with the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ inciting them and directing their anger towards us."
 antiquarians_estate_events.5.a: "Ok."
 antiquarians_estate_events.6.t: "Triumph of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$?"
 antiquarians_estate_events.6.d: "While none would openly defy the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ there are few states where they are as influential as in [Root.GetName]. There isn't a single institution in our country that isn't entirely under the influence of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ and the power of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] depends on them now more than ever.\nIt is perhaps only natural that the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ now also wishes to take a more active role in the practical ruling of our country. Lately a number of suggestions have been made by their representatives to further harmonize our laws and traditions with those of the spiritual realm. The ambition is to cleanse our court culture from any unorthodoxy and to ensure that the country is governed according to religiously sound rules and ideals."
 antiquarians_estate_events.6.a: "Follow the recommendations of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$."
 antiquarians_estate_events.6.b: "Reject their authority."
 antiquarians_estate_events.7.t: "Strong $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$"
 antiquarians_estate_events.7.d: "While many rulers can rely on the support of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ few have as strong supporters as we do. A long tradition of close cooperation and loyalty between us and $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ has resulted in a situation where the Church thinks of itself as a part of the state administration rather than an independent actor. Throughout our state the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ are spreading the word of the excellence and spiritual strength of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 antiquarians_estate_events.7.a: "Great."
 antiquarians_estate_events.8.t: "Land Theft"
 antiquarians_estate_events.8.d: "Many land donations are quite old and while they are always written down both landscape and names may well have changed since a donation was originally written. Recently the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ have been accusing several members of the $ESTATE_ARMY$ of outright land theft in the form of encroaching on lands donated to the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ long ago. The $ESTATE_ARMY$ on the other hand argue that it is the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ who are trying to seize land areas they do not own.\nWhoever we decide to side with will become the majority land holder in the area."

 antiquarians_estate_events.9.d: "There has always been some discrepancy between the religion actually taught and defended by the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ and the actual faith of the people in the provinces. Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems, however, that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."

 antiquarians_estate_events.10.d: "The time has come for the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ to appoint a new leader to assist our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the capital. The likely candidate is an old cleric with a solid history as a prominent member of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$ behind him. He has, however, also acquired many enemies during his life who now hope to see a somewhat younger candidate with a less ugly past be appointed. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it would not be hard to influence this election to the younger candidate who would likely be more loyal. To be seen to meddle in the affairs of the $ESTATE_ANTIQUARIANS$, however, would very likely weaken the faction in the long run."

 army_estate_events.1.d: "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_ARMY$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"

 army_estate_events.3.t: "Encroachment of the $ESTATE_ARMY$ in [noble_encroachment.GetName]"
 army_estate_events.3.d: "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_ARMY$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."

As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_ARMY$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."

In some cases the $ESTATE_UNIONS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_ARMY$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear.

Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_ARMY$ would likely resent it."

 army_estate_events.8.d: "Relations between the $ESTATE_ARMY$ and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_ARMY$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."

Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_ARMY$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."

 press_estate_events.10.d: "Representatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_PRESS$ community appear before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] with a proposal; cement the status of Jainism in both state and society in exchange for the undying loyalty of the community. They mean to achieve this status through the enactment of policies granting religious concessions. These would include the prohibition of animal slaughter, ending the confiscation of the property of the deceased, abolishing religious taxes, and the release of political prisoners with ties to prominent $ESTATE_PRESS$ families.\n\nThese proposals have been met with outrage from the [Root.Religion.GetName] clergy, and are likely to be unpopular throughout the realm. It may be time to sever our close alliance with the $ESTATE_PRESS$."
