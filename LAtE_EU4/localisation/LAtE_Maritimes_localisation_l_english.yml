The duchies, spurred on by the Queen's indecisiveness, have declared their rights to self-governance. All diplomatic ties between the constituent duchies have been severed, and the region stands on the brink of war.\n\nHow will the Queen guide her people in this time of great peril?\n\n§ROrder may only be restored once all core Maritimer provinces are under your control.

By carefully choosing their allegiance, our ruler has led the loyalist army to victory. All eyes turn to our nation as the declaration of the cessation of hostilities is read.\n\nAll that remains is to decide the fate of our newly reclaimed territories.

At only eight years of age, many fear that Ophelia will quickly fall to the many plots and schemes of the powers that be within the realm. The state now risks being torn apart by the myriad factions vying for influence over the direction of the land.\n\nThe governance of a nation is a fearsome task for a queen so young. With enemies on all sides and no relatives to rely upon, the odds seem insurmountable. Should your reign survive until you have reached adulthood, the duchies will surely recognize your divine right to rule and pledge their allegiance. The survival of the realm now hangs by a thread: are you, young Carmody, up to the task, or will you allow your people to fall to ruin?"

Yet another frontier, once thought lost and irreclaimable, has been conquered by our pioneering settlers. With each passing day, tales of riches and discovery arrive in Halifax Harbor in droves. Glory is heaped upon those who take the leap and carve out new lives for themselves in the many Maritimer colonies which sprawl across continental Europe.\n\nNobody basks more in this glory, however, than the daring explorers who made our dominance of the continent possible. Their tireless efforts to spread the Maritimer name and faith cannot go without due recognition, and now many within the court are suggesting that their now legendary status be codified in law with special privileges. To bestow such an honor would doubtless serve all parties involved, and the with its foundation, the Board of Explorers has promised us their unwavering loyalty."

Having spent nearly her entire life at sea, her command over her ship and crew are semi-legendary, and tales of her bolster morale on virtually every seaworthy Maritimer ship. As she grows older, Magnolia has expressed a desire to spend some time on land, and has come to the court to offer her service to the Crown. While we could accept her wishes and employ her as a royal advisor, we could also put her back to sea in our exclusive service should the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] see fit.\n\nHow shall we respond to her offer?"
